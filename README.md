# track

A little wasted time tracking prototype.

This is just me playing around. Please don't use this.

Turns out `optparse-generic` is really cool, but pretty useless -- it doesn't
actually let you do good messages.

Working with time intervals is kind of gross.

YAML has support that's basically identical to JSON in haskell, which is great
for what I wanted.

Haskell without type annotations is pretty usable.
